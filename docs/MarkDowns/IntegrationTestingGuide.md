# Integration Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Smart Fleet Platform end-to-end, verifying that the frontend can communicate with backend services through the API Gateway.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js and npm
- All services started via `run-all.ps1`

## Test Execution Steps

### 1. Start All Services

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd c:\Users\YUSUF SAYED\AI Project 070526\smart-fleet-platform

# Run the startup script
.\run-all.ps1
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- All Docker containers (SQL Server, Kafka, Zookeeper) start successfully
- All .NET services (Fleet, Identity, AI, Notification) start without errors
- Frontend (React/Vite) starts on http://localhost:5173
- API Gateway starts on http://localhost:5000

**Verification:**
- Check docker: `docker ps` (should show 3 containers running)
- Fleet Service Swagger: http://localhost:5081/swagger
- Identity Service Swagger: http://localhost:5057/swagger

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Login fails with 404 or CORS error

**Solution:**
- Verify API Gateway is running on port 5000
- Check Vite proxy config in `vite.config.ts`
- Clear browser cache and localStorage

### Issue: Dashboard shows no data

**Solution:**
- Verify Fleet Service is running on port 5081
- Check database connection: `docker logs smartfleet-sqlserver`
- Verify Kafka is running: `docker logs zookeeper` and `docker logs kafka`

### Issue: "Token invalid or expired"

**Solution:**
- Re-login to get a fresh token
- Check JWT secret in Identity Service configuration
- Verify all services are synchronized on time

- Login API: < 500ms

---

## Success Criteria

✓ All 5 test categories pass
✓ No console errors
✓ All API responses match expected contracts
✓ Frontend gracefully handles error states
✓ UI is responsive across all breakpoints
