# Current Sprint

Sprint Goal:
Complete integration testing and resolve API Gateway routing issues to enable end-to-end testing.

Status:
In Progress - Testing Phase 1 Completed, Issues Identified

Completion: Phase 1 (Testing) = 25% | Phase 2 (Issues Fix) = 0% | Phase 3 (Validation) = 0%

## Phase 1 Findings (Integration Testing - COMPLETE)

### ✅ Successful Service Startups
- [x] Docker infrastructure (SQL Server, Kafka, Zookeeper)
- [x] FleetService (port 5081) - Responding
- [x] IdentityService (port 5057) - Responding
- [x] Frontend (port 5173) - Login page loads
- [x] Frontend production build validated
- [x] All microservices started without fatal errors
- [x] Fleet endpoint `/fleet/Vehicles` validated through gateway
- [x] Fleet maintenance endpoint `/fleet/MaintenanceRecords` validated through gateway
- [x] Fleet fuel endpoint `/fleet/FuelRecords` validated through gateway

### ✅ Gateway Routing Validated
**API Gateway (Ocelot) - Port 5000**
- Gateway is listening and correctly routing `/identity/Auth/login` to IdentityService
- Verified user registration and login through gateway
- Verified `/fleet/Dashboard/stats` through gateway with a JWT token
- Gateway route configuration has been corrected and validated

### 📋 Route Configuration Notes
- Original Ocelot routes used `/api/` prefix but frontend calls `/identity/`, `/fleet/`, `/ai/`
- Fixed routes configuration in ocelot.json to match frontend paths
- Confirmed Identity and Fleet service ports are reachable through gateway
- Updated AI Service port from 5090 to 5091 in routes
- Added missing Dashboard and MaintenanceRecords/FuelRecords routes where needed

**Full Report:** See docs/MarkDowns/IntegrationTestingReport.md

## Phase 2: Recommended Next Steps

### PRIORITY 1: Fix API Gateway
1. Investigate Ocelot startup logs for specific errors
2. Verify ocelot.json syntax is valid JSON
3. Check if Gateway requires async initialization delay
4. Consider simplifying routes if complex configuration causes issues
5. Test Gateway startup in isolation before full service startup

### PRIORITY 2: Reconfigure Service Ports
- Review SmartFleet.Gateway project configuration
- Verify route ordering in ocelot.json (specificity)
- Add health check endpoints for monitoring startup

### PRIORITY 3: Service Discovery
- Implement service health checks before Gateway routes requests
- Add circuit breaker pattern for downstream service failures
- Document service startup order and dependencies

## Test Execution Summary

**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Duration:** ~120 minutes  
**Services Started:** 10 .NET processes, 4 Docker containers  
**Tests Executed:** Auth flow through gateway, dashboard stats through gateway  
**Tests Passed:** 2/8 (gateway auth and dashboard stats validated)  
**Tests Failed:** 0/8 (no gateway routing failures during validation)

Notes:
- Integration Testing Guide: See docs/MarkDowns/IntegrationTestingGuide.md
- Test Report: See docs/MarkDowns/IntegrationTestingReport.md
- Route Configuration: See gateway/ApiGateway/ocelot.json (UPDATED 2026-07-06)
- Direct service access works (FleetService, IdentityService responding)
- **BLOCKING ISSUE:** API Gateway must be fixed before auth flow can be tested
